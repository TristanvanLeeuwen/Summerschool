### Inverse Problems [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TristanvanLeeuwen/Summerschool/blob/main/InverseProblems.ipynb)

Inverse problems occur in many applications and is a classical topic in mathematical analysis. In this module we discuss basic notions in the study of linear inverse problems, including ill-posedness and the pseudo inverse. We focus in particular on image denoising and deconvolution.

### Linear Filters [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TristanvanLeeuwen/Summerschool/blob/main/LinearFilters.ipynb)

A classical way to resolve ill-posedness is Tikhonov regularisation. In the context of denoising, this leads to linear filters.

### Non-Linear Filters [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TristanvanLeeuwen/Summerschool/blob/main/NonLinearFilters.ipynb)

For better performance, non-linear filters may sometimes be preferable over linear ones. A popular non-linear filter results from Total Variation regularisation.

### Compressed Sensing [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TristanvanLeeuwen/Summerschool/blob/main/CompressedSensing.ipynb)

Sparisity turns out to be a key ingredient in non-linear filters. In this module we explore the connections (and differences) between sparse regularisation and compressed sensing.

### Optimisation [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TristanvanLeeuwen/Summerschool/blob/main/Optimisation.ipynb)

Ultimately, regularised deconvolution requires solving an optimisation problem. We discuss the basic proximal gradient method and how denoising can be used as part of a regularised deconvolution problem.

### Dictionary Learning [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TristanvanLeeuwen/Summerschool/blob/main/DictionaryLearning.ipynb)

Regularisation can be tailored more specifically to a particular class of images by learning a dictionary in which the images can be sparsly represented.

### MachineLearning [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TristanvanLeeuwen/Summerschool/blob/main/MachineLearning.ipynb)

Recently, machine learning methods have gained popularity in solving inverse problems. In this module, we explore some of the basics.
